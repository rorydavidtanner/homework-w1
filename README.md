# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

HOME WORK - WEEK 1


REFRACTOR EXISTING CODE FOR A MARKETING AGENCY 




Question:

At one stage I had every thing working fine and then somehow I had all these images appearing and I was unable to see the 'content' content.


Why are there random images appearing over my 

<article class="content">
        <section>

        ??

Thank you.
